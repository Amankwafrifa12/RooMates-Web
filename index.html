                Project Title: MyExpoApp
                Description: Create a full Expo app with the following specifications:
                1. App Purpose:
                o The app should serve as a simple to-do list manager where users can add, edit, and delete tasks.
                o The app should store tasks locally using AsyncStorage.
                2. App Structure:
                o Home Screen:
                 Display a list of to-do tasks.
                 Include an "Add Task" button that navigates to the "Add Task" screen.
                o Add Task Screen:
                 A form with input fields for the task name and description.
                 A "Save" button that saves the task to the local storage and navigates back to the home screen.
                o Edit Task Screen:
                 Pre-filled form with the task details, allowing users to update the task.
                 An "Update" button that saves changes to the local storage and navigates back to the home screen.
                o Task Details Screen:
                 Display the task name and description.
                 Include "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.
                3. Navigation:
                o Use React Navigation to handle screen transitions.
                o Include a bottom tab navigator with two tabs: "Tasks" (Home Screen) and "Settings" (a basic screen
                with a placeholder text).
                4. State Management:
                o Manage app state using React's useState and useEffect hooks.
                o Store and retrieve tasks from AsyncStorage.
                5. Styling:
                o Apply simple and clean styling using StyleSheet in React Native.
                o The app should be responsive and work well on different screen sizes.
                6. Other Features:
                o Add a search bar on the home screen to filter tasks by name.
                o Display a confirmation dialog when a user tries to delete a task.
                o Implement a dark mode toggle in the Settings screen.
                7. Testing:
                o Include basic testing with Jest to ensure the core functionalities (adding, editing, deleting tasks)
                work correctly.
                8. Documentation:
                o Provide clear comments in the code.
                o Include a README file with instructions on how to run the app, including any necessary dependencies.
